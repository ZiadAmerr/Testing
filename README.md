# Testing

This is a Java project for testing the `ArrayTools` class, which provides various methods for working with arrays of integers. The project includes the `ArrayTools` class, the `ArrayToolsTest` class for testing the `ArrayTools` methods, and other future classes and their tests.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you should clone the repository to your local machine:

`
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Testing.git
`


Then, open the project in your favorite Java development environment (e.g. Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.) and run the `ArrayToolsTest` class to execute the test cases.

## ArrayTools

The `ArrayTools` class provides the following methods for working with arrays of integers:

- `max(int[] arr)`: Returns the maximum value in the given array.
- `min(int[] arr)`: Returns the minimum value in the given array.
- `avg(int[] arr)`: Returns the average value of the given array.
- `sum(int[] arr)`: Returns the sum of the values in the given array.
- `range(int[] arr)`: Returns the range (i.e. the difference between the maximum and minimum values) of the given array.

## ArrayToolsTest

The `ArrayToolsTest` class provides test cases for each of the methods in the `ArrayTools` class. The test cases cover various scenarios, including arrays with positive, negative, and mixed numbers, arrays with duplicate and all equal values, arrays with a single element or no elements, and arrays with null values.

## Future Classes and Tests

In the future, additional classes and tests may be added to the project to expand its functionality and test coverage.
